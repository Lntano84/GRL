# GRL Research State

Last updated: 2026-09-04

## Scope
The project targets **Influence Maximization** rather than generic combinatorial optimization.

## Current repository baseline
- Primary workspace: `/workspace/GRL`
- Git remote: `GaoYucen/GRL`
- Main branch: `main`
- The repository contains a structured baseline with `configs/`, `docs/`, `scripts/`, `src/grl/`, and `tests/`.

## Confirmed research findings
- Predicting conditional **marginal gain** is a more promising learning target than directly predicting the final solution/set.
- Validation should emphasize whether the model correctly ranks candidate nodes under a fixed current seed set/state, not only global regression error.
- The current ICLR 2027-oriented route is a **learning-augmented sequential IM solver**: state-aware marginal prediction → progressive candidate/sample verification → online trust audit → classical-oracle fallback.
- The predictor should be treated as a proposal/ranking mechanism rather than a complete replacement for MC/RIS marginal-gain estimation.

## Current technical direction
1. Learn / estimate conditional marginal gain Δ(v|S) with explicit state-aware supervision.
2. Use learned scores to propose/rank candidates at each sequential greedy step.
3. Adapt both the number of verified candidates and the MC samples allocated to them.
4. Audit learned ranking online using predicted-head and sentinel candidates.
5. Increase oracle effort automatically when trust degrades; approach classical Full-MC/RIS behavior when prediction is unreliable.
6. Evaluate downstream influence spread, oracle/sample savings, robustness, and generalization—not prediction accuracy alone.

## Current workspace note
Several GRL-specific pre-experiment/worktree directories currently live inside `/workspace/GRL`. They are intentionally left untouched. Future GRL temporary artifacts should remain inside the GRL project directory rather than `/workspace` root.

## Source of truth
- Code/config/reproducible artifacts: GitHub + `/workspace/GRL`
- Human-readable research plan and decisions: Notion GRL Research
- Current machine-independent project state: this file plus `DECISIONS.md`, `EXPERIMENT_LOG.md`, and `NEXT_STEPS.md`

## 2026-09-03 verified update — state-aware oracle and first end-to-end prototype
- Strict disjoint unseen-state validation confirms that marginal-gain prediction remains a viable core learning target, but seed-mask ablations and overlap stress exposed a candidate-strength shortcut in the original predictor.
- State-sensitive difficult-state training plus same-candidate delta supervision substantially restores conditionality: same-candidate cross-state Spearman improved from 0.267 to 0.908 while preserving strong ordinary candidate ranking.
- A candidate-conditioned residual ablation further demonstrated that explicit candidate–seed interactions can recover state-response amplitude, but candidate-specific drop calibration is not yet solved; this is not the current bottleneck to framework integration.
- The first end-to-end sequential IM framework is implemented with learned-oracle, batched-MC-oracle, full-greedy, learned-greedy, and selective-refinement components.
- NetHEPT first prototype (fixed 128-candidate pool, budget 10, MC=40 for selection, MC=1000 for final spread): Full-MC spread 444.911; learned-only state-aware spread 321.526 (72.3% of Full-MC); selective Top-8/16/32 reaches 92.6%/93.1%/95.0% of Full-MC while using 6.5%/13.0%/25.9% of Full-MC exact candidate evaluations.
- Interpretation: the end-to-end learning-augmented route is operational, but learned-only ranking is not reliable enough for sequential IM. Selective verification is essential.

## 2026-09-03 adaptive certification milestone
- Sequential diagnosis on the Full-MC trajectory shows the learned ranks of the true best candidate are `[1, 57, 87, 2, 2, 42, 1, 8, 1, 32]`; offline marginal-ranking metrics therefore overstate fixed-shortlist reliability.
- Adaptive residual-envelope refinement (`beta=0.5`) reaches **443.626 spread = 99.71% of Full-MC** with **512 / 1235 = 41.46%** of exact candidate evaluations.
- Reusing common live-edge worlds within each greedy step reduces adaptive live-edge generation from 2560 to 400 and prototype selection time from 139.7s to 32.4s without changing quality.
- Current certification is empirical/operational; formal uncertainty calibration and a robustness guarantee remain open.

## 2026-09-03 update — progressive two-dimensional oracle adaptation
The learned marginal oracle proposes a ranking; adaptive residual-envelope certification determines how many candidates receive exact verification; progressive common-random-number MC allocates 5→10→20→40 worlds only as needed. Candidate/world results are cached.

Current recommended fast-path prototype (`residual_beta=0.5`, `confidence_z=0.5`, `bootstrap_mc=10`) reaches spread 443.626 = 99.71% of Full-MC using 504/1235 exact candidate evaluations and 18,280/49,400 MC candidate-samples.

## 2026-09-04 update — trust-aware robustness mechanism
A randomized-predictor stress test showed that progressive/residual certification alone can become falsely confident: it used only 5,560 candidate-samples and collapsed to 83.06% of Full-MC quality. This invalidated a naive robustness claim.

The repair is an online trust audit over predicted-head and rank-spaced sentinel candidates. Untrusted steps ignore learned ranking and fall back to all-candidate MC40; trusted steps use the progressive fast path. This yields the desired architectural behavior: good predictions reduce oracle work, bad predictions trigger more exact work.

## 2026-09-04 verified update — multi-seed consistency/robustness pilot
The frozen trust-progressive configuration was evaluated over five independent repeats with separate predictor-corruption, exact-MC, and final-evaluation random seeds. Each repeat used a same-seed Full-MC reference. NetHEPT, shared 128-candidate pool, budget 10.

Aggregate results:
- Full-MC spread: **445.154 ± 3.154**, 49,400 candidate-samples.
- Clean predictor: quality ratio **1.0005 ± 0.0082**, **26,004 samples = 52.6%** of Full-MC, **4.4 ± 1.5 fallback steps**.
- Moderate corruption (`alpha=0.5`, predictor Spearman ≈0.624): quality ratio **1.0030 ± 0.0093**, **24,542 samples = 49.7%**, **4.0 ± 1.6 fallbacks**.
- Strong corruption (`alpha=0.75`, predictor Spearman ≈0.248): quality ratio **1.0019 ± 0.0045**, **41,171 samples = 83.3%**, **7.6 ± 0.5 fallbacks**.
- Random predictor (`alpha=1`, predictor Spearman ≈−0.040): quality ratio **0.9998 ± 0.0005**, **47,161 samples = 95.5%**, **9.4 ± 0.9 fallbacks**.

**Current interpretation:** the central empirical learning-augmented story now survives independent randomness: final quality remains essentially at Full-MC while oracle effort rises strongly as prediction quality collapses. The random-predictor endpoint no longer catastrophically fails and instead approaches classical Full-MC cost.

**Current bottleneck:** clean-case trust efficiency is variable. Across clean repeats, fallback count ranges 2–6/10 and sample fraction 41.4%–64.2%. Robustness is therefore no longer the first problem to solve; the next methodological task is **held-out/statistical trust calibration to reduce false distrust and efficiency variance without weakening the severe-failure fallback**.

**Important caveat:** ratios above 1 are finite-MC / trajectory noise and must not be framed as outperforming Full-MC greedy. All current end-to-end results are still on a fixed 128-candidate prototype pool, not full-graph/RIS paper-scale evaluation.

## 2026-09-04 verified update — audited residual gate becomes the main trust mechanism
Held-out analysis invalidated local audit Spearman as the primary trust statistic: high local rank correlation does not guarantee that a strong outsider was not omitted. The main trust mechanism is therefore now an **audited residual upper-bound test** over predicted-head plus rank-spaced sentinel candidates.

Frozen prototype rule: `residual_q=1.0`, `residual_beta=0`, Top-16 + 8 sentinels at MC20, followed by progressive 5→10→20→40 verification when trusted. Five independent NetHEPT repeats on the 128-candidate prototype show sample fraction rising from **41.9%±4.0%** for a clean predictor to **57.9%±10.1%** at strong corruption and **84.8%±7.7%** for a random predictor, while final spread remains within finite-MC variation of the same-seed Full-MC references.

**Current interpretation:** the core consistency–robustness architecture is now empirically credible at the 128-candidate prototype scale. The next bottleneck is no longer trust-threshold tuning; it is **candidate-scale / graph-scale validation** and eventual replacement of the NetworkX MC prototype with a scalable RIS/all-node oracle.

## 2026-09-04 latest diagnosis — large-candidate proposal quality is now P0
The five-seed 128-candidate result remains a valid prototype milestone, but candidate scaling invalidates any claim that the current audited-residual rule is already scalable. At pool sizes 256/512, the true Full-MC winner increasingly falls far down the clean learned ranking: mean rank **23.3 → 39.9 → 71.6** and Top64 recall **0.9 → 0.7 → 0.5**. On pool512, exact winners appear at ranks 144, 173 and 160 on hard sequential states.

This means the next method iteration should not try to rescue the system only by certifying a weak proposal. The proposal itself should be trained explicitly for **large-candidate, sequential hard-negative ranking**, while retaining the already verified state-sensitive same-candidate delta supervision. The certificate should then be redesigned independently using population-wide random/sentinel audits and a calibrated/conformal upper-tail bound that accounts for the number of unseen candidates.

## 2026-09-05 — Full-graph RR screening + 128 shortlist 闭环通过 {#FULLGRAPH_RR_SCREENING_20260905}

当前主线从“人为 Top-degree 128”升级为完整图输入：`NetHEPT 15,233 nodes -> independent RR screening -> Top-128 shortlist -> state-aware marginal proposal -> audited residual + progressive verification -> Full-MC fallback`。

3 个独立 repeat（screening RR 与 full-graph RR baseline 使用独立 50k RR samples）结果：
- independent RR-greedy seed recall in Top-128: **1.0000 ± 0.0000**；
- full-graph independent RR-sketch greedy spread: **506.7407 ± 3.5330**；
- screened Full-MC40 spread: **508.4677 ± 1.9645**；
- audited/progressive spread: **500.9403 ± 2.4410**；
- audited / screened Full-MC quality: **0.9852 ± 0.0035**；
- audited / full-graph RR-sketch quality: **0.9886 ± 0.0109**；
- expensive MC sample fraction: **0.5908 ± 0.0846**（约 40.9% reduction）；
- fallback: **4.0 ± 1.63 / 10 steps**；
- pairwise shortlist Jaccard: **0.6954 ± 0.0092**。

Interpretation: 128 不再是人为 toy pool，而是完整图上的 cheap screening budget。不同 RR 随机种子得到的 shortlist 并不完全相同，但独立 RR-greedy 的强 seed 在 3/3 repeats 中均被覆盖。当前可以认为 full-graph-input learning-augmented closure 已经跑通。

Caveat: 这里的 50k RR baseline 是 prototype RR-sketch greedy，不等同于正式 IMM/OPIM-C 等带理论采样量的 paper-grade RIS baseline；不能据此声称优于 RIS。下一步先验证 shortlist budget M={64,128,256}，再做 k={5,10,20} 和多图/正式 RIS baseline。


## 2026-09-05 P0 paper-value risk — official OPIM-C same-protocol comparison
Official OPIM-C (Tang et al., SIGMOD 2018; source `tangj90/OPIM`, commit `344cc3d5eaa13d8cdf9a9e75722e49d341981e8d`) is now running on the same NetHEPT IC data used by GRL. For `k=10`, `eps=0.1`, its returned original-node seed set is `[267, 6024, 47, 66, 1241, 3210, 37, 1434, 12464, 156]` (internal GRL indices `[1265, 8595, 308, 410, 3219, 5753, 228, 3519, 13507, 892]`).

Using exactly the three final-evaluation seeds from the existing full-graph closure (`1900401, 1901422, 1902443`) and `MC=1000`, OPIM-C obtains spread `504.017 / 501.763 / 500.568`, i.e. **502.116 ± 1.430**. The existing audited learning-augmented method is **500.940 ± 2.441**; full-graph independent 50k-RR greedy is **506.741 ± 3.533**; screened Full-MC40 is **508.468 ± 1.965**. Hence audited/OPIM-C = **0.99766**: quality is essentially the same at current Monte-Carlo resolution and must not be framed as an advantage over OPIM-C.

Runtime exposes a more serious paper-value issue. Across the three existing full-graph repeats, RR screening takes **0.482 ± 0.116 s** and audited sequential selection takes **24.502 ± 1.633 s**, for about **24.984 s** screen+selection. The official OPIM-C executable takes about **0.602 s** for optimization; its graph-format/reverse-graph step takes about **0.069 s** and successfully writes the reverse graph (the formatter returns code 1 despite the successful output). Thus the current prototype is roughly **37× slower** in optimization-path wall time while producing comparable spread.

**Interpretation:** the frozen method chain remains mechanically complete, but the paper-value closure is not. Before expanding to multi-graph, `k={5,10,20}`, or large ablations, we need a human decision on why learned advice is necessary relative to mature RIS. Plausible reframings are an expensive/nonstandard black-box influence oracle, a repeated-query/changing-state setting where learned representations can be amortized, or a safe fallible-advice methodology with a clearly motivated setting. Do not automatically add a new method module or locally tune runtime to hide this structural comparison.

Evidence is saved at `outputs/baselines/opim_c_nethept_k10_eps01/same_protocol_eval.json` on the 4090 workspace.

## 2026-09-05 P0-RESCUE — classical RR rescues runtime, learning value unresolved

A same-protocol rescue study replaced the old ~24.5 s sequential Monte-Carlo audit with independent RR verification inside the frozen full-graph-screened M=128 shortlist. Across three independent final-evaluation seeds, pure-RR verification gave: 1k RR = 335.657 ± 77.912 at 0.484 s; 2k = 461.309 ± 27.889 at 0.495 s; 5k = 453.223 ± 25.848 at 0.518 s; 10k = 486.321 ± 11.505 at 0.559 s; 20k = 502.446 ± 7.264 at 0.652 s; 50k = **506.588 ± 2.302 at 0.909 ± 0.037 s**.

The 50k verifier reaches **99.51% of official IMM spread** (IMM 509.081 ± 0.842 at ~0.287 s) and repairs the old GRL path (500.940 ± 2.441 at ~24.984 s), while 20k RR is close to the OPIM-C operating point (502.446 / 0.652 s versus 502.116 ± 1.430 / ~0.672 s). However, this rescue is entirely classical RR computation; 50k screening + 50k independent verification is not evidence of lower sampling cost than mature RIS.

The current tuned state-aware learned marginal predictor does not yet reduce the RR evidence needed for near-IMM quality. Learned-only remained poor (~324–333 spread in observed repeats), and hard learned-Top16 guidance was worse than pure RR at each completed low-budget pilot (1k: 378.812 vs 424.797; 2k: 384.294 vs 433.680; 5k: 374.293 vs 478.747; 10k: 402.223 vs 496.804).

**Paper-level judgment:** the engineering runtime bottleneck is largely solved, but the learning-value hypothesis in vanilla static IC is not. The current route cannot claim better quality, runtime, or demonstrated sample efficiency from learning relative to mature RIS. This is a **YELLOW / human paper-positioning review** boundary. Do not expand to multi-graph, k-sensitivity, broad ablations, a new predictor architecture, RL, or a new IM setting without human authorization.
